                No! <br />
                Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone.
                <br />
                <br />
                Do not believe the claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise
                or an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for
                vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know better.
                <br />
                Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each
                individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise.
                <br />
                <br />
                In some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras
                celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.

                The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the
                Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.
                <br />
                <br />
                Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday
                each year. Fat Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot.
                Sometimes it will change from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a
                good idea to layer your clothes since a chilly morning may turn into a warm
                afternoon. <br /><br />
                Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes
                that can get somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms
                are predicted, then you’ll definitely want to bring a raincoat!

                The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi
                Gras. This is the weekend when Bacchus and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of
                the season, roll down the streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day
                Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a weekend,
                Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days to experience Mardi Gras.
                Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras
                festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and
                seeing all of the costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.

                By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family
                celebration. Those of us who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children
                have grown up and we continue going to every parade because we used to use "taking
                the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all
                of the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and
                more.
                <br /><br />
                The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size
                parades pass anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles
                Avenue near Napoleon since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route.
                The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family area where you will see many
                families staking out their parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball,
                and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about the
                streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.
                <br /><br />
                You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like
                Metairie, which is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade,
                the Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi
                Gras day. Kids love it!

                The Mardi Gras Indians only parade on Mardi Gras day and on Super Sunday (generally
                the Sunday closest to St. Joseph’s Day in March).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but they happen in and around
                their inner-city neighborhoods. Some sources say that you will see the Creole Wild
                West tribe at the corner of LaSalle and 2nd Streets sometime between 9 a.m. and 11
                a.m. after the Krewe of Zulu passes by. Other tribes meet at the corner of Claiborne
                and Orleans following the Zulu parade.
              </p>
              <p>
                The New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday on the
                third Sunday of March, around St. Joseph's Day. Their festivities begin at Noon in
                A. L. Davis Park (at Washington & LaSalle Streets) where the Mardi Gras Indians once
                again dress in their feathers and suits, and take to the streets to meet other
                "gangs."

              <p>
                Also, the Tambourine and Fan organizations traditionally hold their "Super Sunday"
                parade on the Sunday closest to St. Joseph's Day, with the event beginning at Bayou
                St. John. In recent years, there has been yet a third Super Sunday called Big Sunday
                that falls in April during the open weekend between French Quarter Festival and Jazz
                Fest. No specific details are available on these events at this time.
