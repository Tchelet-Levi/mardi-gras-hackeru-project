# HackerU - Mardi Gras project by Tchelet Levi

The goal of this project for me was to use as little external code as possible and to challenge my SCSS / CSS and Javascript skills.

Every component you see in this project is made by me.

Due to not having access to frameworks such as React or Svelte, making reusable components proved itself difficult, so in order to not spend too much time on these components, I left them somewhat incomplete in terms of their reusability.
I know I could use Web Components for this but I felt like it would be a bit of a waste of my time to learn Web Components when modern frameworks exist.
